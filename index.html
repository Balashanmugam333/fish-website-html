Besides these, there are numerous number of species are found in aquatic ecosystem.The more we will search, the more we will find new species. The researchers believe that there is millions of species both plants and animals are still undiagonised and unspecified. And most of them believe that so many species are already distincted and can never be in existence except identifying there fossils.The prospect of what equipment to use can be quite intimidating to a new fisherman but the key is to slow down, take a deep breath and think about the equipment logically as it really is just a matter of common sense. It really is a case of attaching the right rod to the right reel, to the right lure and hey presto you are fishing. Bass fishing lures come in all shapes and sizes ranging from brightly colored plugs which are used attract bass, to spinners which are three hooks which spin to imitate a propeller motion.
